It's a little page 404 error that I made in the theme of Lobotomy Corporation.
Github Page: https://sephiryah.github.io/404-page/

##Who did this project?

Nicolas (SÃ©phirah)

##Who took what part?

Nobody, I was alone.

##Why create this project?

It was an exercise I have to make. I decided to make it in the theme of Lobotomy Corporaton, the game I like the most, because this page is a little trap of the CSS grid project.

##What language are used?

Only HTML & CSS.

##Library?

No library was used.

##What the easiest part?

Make the text.

##What the hardest part?

The image. I have to find an alternative for the three alarm image behind the text, because it was too small.
